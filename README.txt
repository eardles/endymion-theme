This is a copy of my endemion theme folder. Included in it are the gulpfile.js and package.json files. These files are actually in the root foder of my installation (localhost:drupal-4) and not in the endymion theme folder. I had problems with the gulpfile only handling one single sass import, but this latest gulpfile handles multiple imports. The **/* globbing doesn't work and I had to use only /*. This is fine for me as I do not intend to go to any more depths of nesting. Another problem is that broswer-sync no longer updates the site automatically, but this is only a matter of hitting refresh, and I can live with that.
